Start with OOPs concept

Abstraction :

using 
- Class // Topic of discussion
- Function
- Header


class
	- data
		- data types
			basic types -> int, float, char 
			compound type/user defined type
				same type : Array, enum
				distinct types : struct, union, class
				generic type : templates

		- type qualifier
			const 
			mutable
			static 
			volatile

		- data manipulators

	- member function
		take inputs, do some calculation and return result


Access control mechanism
	private
	public
	protected

Encapsulation -> binding function to member variables by puttin it both in a single unit
